# RmbRT Language Compiler Readme

## How to install

### Cloning

```git clone https://github.com/RmbRT/rlc.git```

### Compiling

Navigate into the cloned directory, then execute:

```cmake .```

to generate the necessary project / make files your machine needs to build the library. This also copies all header files into the directory ```rlc/include/rlc/```.

### Generating documentation

You need to have doxygen installed on your machine. Navigate into the ```rlc/doxygen/``` directory, and issue:

```doxygen Doxyfile```

This generates a HTML documentation based on the comments in the code, and places it in ```rlc/doxygen/html/```.
